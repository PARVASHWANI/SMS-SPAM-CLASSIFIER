# SMS-SPAM-CLASSIFIER
Build my first spam classifier using Tf-IDF Vectorizer, and the Naïve Bayes model!

Tf-IDF stands for Term frequency-inverse document frequency
It is a text vectorizer that transforms the text into a usable vector. It combines 2 concepts, Term Frequency (TF) and Document Frequency (DF).

Term Frequency (TF) is the number of occurrences of a specific term in a document.Term frequency indicates how important a specific term in a document.

Document Frequency (DF) is the number of documents containing a specific term. Document frequency indicates how common the term is.

Inverse document frequency (IDF) is the weight of a term, it aims to reduce the weight of a term if the term’s occurrences are scattered throughout all the documents.

A naive Bayes classifier is an algorithm that uses Bayes' theorem to classify objects. Naive Bayes classifiers assume strong, or naive, independence between attributes of data points. Popular uses of naive Bayes classifiers include spam filters, text analysis and medical diagnosis.

Bayes' Theorem states that the conditional probability of an event, based on the occurrence of another event, is equal to the likelihood of the second event given the first event multiplied by the probability of the first event.
